import React, { useState } from 'react';

function counter(){
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const increment = () => {
        setCount(count + 1);
    };


The error you are encountering is because the function component name counter starts with a lowercase letter, which goes against the naming convention for React components. React components should start with an uppercase letter.

To fix the issue, simply change the name of your function component to start with an uppercase letter, and also, since you are using useState, you can rename the function to Counter and make it a valid React component.

updated code:
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() { // Changed the function name to start with an uppercase letter
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };
